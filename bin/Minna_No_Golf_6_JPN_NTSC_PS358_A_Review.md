Here are some tips and tricks to help you master Minna No Golf 6 JPN NTSC PS3-58:
 
- Use the right club for the right situation. Each club has a different range, accuracy, and spin. You can switch clubs by pressing the L1 and R1 buttons. You can also adjust the loft and impact point of your club by pressing the up and down buttons on the directional pad.
- Pay attention to the wind direction and speed. The wind can affect the trajectory and distance of your shot. You can see the wind indicator on the top right corner of the screen. The arrow shows the direction and the number shows the speed in meters per second. You can also use the touchpad on the PS3 controller to check the wind conditions on the course.
- Use the shot gauge to control your power and accuracy. The shot gauge is a circular meter that appears on the bottom left corner of the screen when you are ready to swing. The gauge has three segments: power, impact, and accuracy. You can use the X button to start and stop the gauge. The first time you press X, the power segment will fill up. The second time you press X, the impact segment will stop. The third time you press X, the accuracy segment will stop. The closer you stop the segments to their optimal points, the better your shot will be.
- Use the spin feature to adjust your ball's trajectory and bounce. You can add spin to your ball by pressing the square, triangle, circle, or cross buttons after hitting the ball. The square button adds backspin, which makes your ball stop faster on the green. The triangle button adds topspin, which makes your ball roll farther on the fairway. The circle button adds right spin, which makes your ball curve to the right. The cross button adds left spin, which makes your ball curve to the left.
- Practice your skills in the challenge mode. The challenge mode is a mode where you can complete various tasks and earn stars. You can access the challenge mode from the main menu or from the course selection screen. There are four types of challenges: beginner, intermediate, advanced, and expert. Each challenge has a different difficulty level and objective. Some examples of challenges are hitting a certain number of birdies, getting a hole-in-one, or beating a rival character.
