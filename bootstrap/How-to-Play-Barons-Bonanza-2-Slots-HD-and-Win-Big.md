In this article, we will explain how to play Barons Bonanza 2 Slots HD and win big. We will also give you some tips and tricks to increase your chances of hitting the jackpot. Let's get started!
  
## How to Play Barons Bonanza 2 Slots HD
  
Barons Bonanza 2 Slots HD is a 5-reel slot game with up to 50 paylines. You can choose how many paylines you want to activate, and how much you want to bet per line. The minimum bet is $0.01 per line, and the maximum bet is $5 per line. The total bet is the product of the number of paylines and the bet per line.
  
The game has a World War I theme, and the symbols include planes, bombs, medals, helmets, goggles, and letters. The Baron is the wild symbol, which can substitute for any other symbol except the scatter symbol. The scatter symbol is a plane, which can trigger the flying feature.
  
### The Flying Feature
  
The flying feature is the main attraction of Barons Bonanza 2 Slots HD. It is activated when you get 3 or more plane symbols anywhere on the reels. You will start with a minimum of 10 free spins, with all wins multiplied by 2. If you get 4 or more plane symbols, you will also get four reel sets to play with.
  
Before the free spins start, you will have to choose from 10 targets on a map. Each target can reveal extra free spins or a higher multiplier. You can keep choosing until you find the Red Baron, who will end your selections.
  
During the free spins, the Red Baron will fly across the reels. You can tap on his plane to try and shoot him down. If you succeed, you will win a bonus amount based on your last win. If you see a gold zeppelin fly across, shoot it down too. It will double the Baron's accumulator.
  
#### The Baron's Accumulator
  
The Baron's accumulator is a special meter that shows above the reels during the flying feature. Every win during the free spins is added to this meter. At the end of the flying feature, you will win the entire value of this meter.
  
However, there is a catch. Every time a Red Baron flies past without being shot down, the Baron's accumulator will reset to zero. So make sure you don't miss any shots!
  
##### The Gold-Mine Jackpot
  
The gold-mine jackpot is another way to win big in Barons Bonanza 2 Slots HD. It is triggered when you get three gold mine symbols on reels 1, 3, and 5 during the flying feature.
  
You will then enter a bonus round where you have to pick from seven mines in an underwater minefield. Each mine has a letter of the word JACKPOT. If you find all seven letters, you will win the jackpot plus any bonus amounts from previous picks.
  
If you pick an exploding mine, you will lose the bonus round and all bonus amounts. So be careful!
  
###### Tips and Tricks
  
Here are some tips and tricks to help you play Barons Bonanza 2 Slots HD and win big:
  
- Play with all 50 paylines activated. This will increase your chances of getting winning combinations and triggering the flying feature.
