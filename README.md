# clojerl

Clojure implemented on the Erlang VM.

## Rationale

Erlang is a great language for building safe, reliable and scalable systems. It provides immutable, persistent data structures out-of-the-box and itâ€™s concurrency semantics are unequalled by any other language.

Clojure is a Lisp and as such come with all the goodies Lisps provide, but it also introduces powerful abstractions to the already impressive feature list: protocols, multimethods and seqs, to name a few.

Clojure was built with concurrency in mind and simplify the development of concurrent programs, most of its concurrency abstractions have a natural translation in Erlang. It is fair to say that combining the power of the Erlang VM with the expressiveness of Clojure, could provide an interesting, useful result to make the lives of many programmers simpler and make the world a happier place.

## Goals

- Interoperability as smooth as possible, just like Clojure proper and ClojureScript do.
- Provide most Clojure abstractions.
- Provide all Erlang abstractions and toolset.
- Include a default OTP library in Clojerl.

## Personal Goal

Learn more about the Erlang and its VM, Clojure and language implementation.

This project is an experiment that I hope others will find useful. Regardless of whether it becomes a fully functional implementation of Clojure or not, I think I will have learned a lot along the way :).

You can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/jfacorro) or lurking on [Clojure](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/clojure)'s and [Erlang](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/erlang-programming)'s mailing lists.

Any feedback, comment and/or suggestion is welcome!
