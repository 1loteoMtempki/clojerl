Congratulations! You have successfully rooted your Asus ZenFone with ZenFoneRootKit Tools. Now you can enjoy the benefits of having root access on your device. However, remember to be careful with what you do with your device, as rooting can also cause some issues if not done properly. Always backup your data before making any changes, and only install trusted apps and ROMs from reputable sources.
  
If you want to customize your ZenFone even further, you might want to install a custom ROM on it. A custom ROM is a modified version of the Android operating system that can offer better performance, battery life, features, and aesthetics than the stock ROM. However, installing a custom ROM also requires some additional steps and precautions, such as unlocking the bootloader, installing a custom recovery, and wiping the data.
 
There are many custom ROMs available for different ZenFone models, but some of the most popular ones are LineageOS, Pixel Experience, Resurrection Remix, and AOSP Extended. You can find these ROMs and more on websites like XDA Developers, where you can also find detailed guides on how to install them. Before you flash any ROM, make sure to check the compatibility with your device model and firmware version, and follow the instructions carefully.
 
Another way to enhance your ZenFone experience is to install some useful apps that require root access. These apps can help you tweak your device settings, optimize your battery life, backup and restore your data, block ads, and more. Some of the best root apps for ZenFone are Greenify, Titanium Backup, AdAway, Magisk Manager, and Tasker. You can find these apps and more on the Google Play Store or other sources like APKMirror.
